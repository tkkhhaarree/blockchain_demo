<h3>A simple working demo of a blockchain node.</h3>
1. The node 1.py file is a flask server containing code for a simple blockchain node.
2. replicate the node 1.py and run them on different local servers to demonstrate multiple nodes of a blockchain. networks.
3. run different URL endpoints available in the code (/mine_block, /get_chain, /is_valid etc) using a REST client (postman, insomnia etc).
